# Web App Security Automation Tool 

# 1. About the project

This project is a comprehensive web app security automation tool crafted with Python and Bash scripting. It streamlines reconnaissance—a critical phase in penetration testing—by automating repetitive tasks. The tool includes scripts to detect common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), subdomain takeover, open directories, server misconfigurations, sensitive information disclosure, S3 bucket takeovers, WordPress misconfigurations, and templates for CVE detection. Designed to run efficiently in the cloud, these automation scripts significantly reduce testing and reconnaissance time, making them indispensable for security professionals.
